To run the application, 
1. Unzip the folder
2. Open a terminal window within the project folder
3. Run npm install
4. Run npm start
5. Open your browser window to localhost:3000

To run the tests I created, simply run npm test after npm install has been run. 
The relevant code can be found in testKeypress.js (a simplified version of my keypress event listener) and test.js.
